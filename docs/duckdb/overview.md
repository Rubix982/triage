# DuckDB Overview

DuckDB is an in-process SQL OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) database management system focused on analytical queries. Unlike traditional client-server database management systems, DuckDB is embedded within the application that uses it.

| -------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------- | ------------------- |
| Focus                | Analytical (OLAP) | Transactional (OLTP) | Varies              |
| Storage              | Columnar          | Row-based            | Typically row-based |
| Architecture         | Embedded          | Embedded             | Client-server       |
| Parallelism          | Yes               | Limited              | Yes                 |
| Vectorized Execution | Yes               | No                   | Varies              |
| Transaction Support  | Yes               | Yes                  | Yes                 |

## Common Use Cases

- **Data analysis**: Fast queries on structured data
- **ETL pipelines**: Efficient data transformation
- **Embedded analytics**: Within applications that need analytical capabilities
- **Interactive dashboards**: Quick response times for data visualization
- **Local data processing**: Working with CSV, Parquet, JSON files

## Getting Started

To start using DuckDB, you can:

1. Download the CLI from the [official website](https://duckdb.org/docs/installation/)
2. Install language bindings for Python, R, Java, and others
3. Use the DuckDB extension for existing database systems like SQLite

## Basic Example

```sql
-- Create a table
CREATE TABLE employees (id INTEGER, name VARCHAR, department VARCHAR, salary DECIMAL);

-- Insert data
INSERT INTO employees VALUES (1, 'Alice', 'Engineering', 85000);
INSERT INTO employees VALUES (2, 'Bob', 'Marketing', 75000);
INSERT INTO employees VALUES (3, 'Charlie', 'Engineering', 90000);

-- Run an analytical query
SELECT department, AVG(salary) as avg_salary, COUNT(*) as employee_count
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
ORDER BY avg_salary DESC;
```

DuckDB is ideal for scenarios where you need the analytical power of a data warehouse but with the simplicity and integration capability of an embedded database like SQLite.
