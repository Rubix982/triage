# Data Extraction Gaps Analysis

## What You're Currently Missing vs What You Need

### 1. **Jira Integration - Missing People Network Data**

#### Currently Extracting:
```rust
pub assignee: Option<String>,
pub reporter: Option<String>,
```

#### MISSING - Need to Extract:
- **Comment authors**: Who responded to tickets
- **Watchers**: Who follows this ticket  
- **Transition history**: Who moved ticket through workflow
- **@Mentions in comments**: Who was tagged in discussions
- **Reaction data**: Who thumbs-up'd comments (if available)
- **Attachment sharers**: Who added documents
- **Link sharers**: Who pasted external links

#### Enhanced Jira Extraction Needed:
```rust
// In your jira.rs - need to extract comment details
pub struct JiraComment {
    pub id: String,
    pub author: String,           // MISSING: you only get comment text
    pub body: String,
    pub created: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub updated: Option<DateTime<Utc>>,
    pub mentions: Vec<String>,    // MISSING: extract @mentions from body
    pub attachments: Vec<String>, // MISSING: files they added
    pub reactions: Vec<Reaction>, // MISSING: if available
}

pub struct JiraTransition {
    pub from_status: String,
    pub to_status: String,
    pub author: String,           // MISSING: who made the change
    pub timestamp: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub comment: Option<String>,  // MISSING: transition comments
}

// Enhanced extraction for full participation
pub struct EnhancedJiraIssue {
    pub issue: Issue,
    pub comments: Vec<JiraComment>,        // MISSING: individual comment details
    pub transitions: Vec<JiraTransition>, // MISSING: status change history
    pub watchers: Vec<String>,            // MISSING: who's following
    pub mentions: Vec<String>,            // MISSING: all @mentions across description/comments
    pub link_shares: Vec<LinkShare>,      // MISSING: who shared what links
}

pub struct LinkShare {
    pub url: String,
    pub shared_by: String,        // MISSING: who pasted this link
    pub shared_in: String,        // description vs comment_id
    pub context: String,          // surrounding text
    pub timestamp: DateTime<Utc>,
}
```

### 2. **Google Integration - Missing Collaboration Data**

#### Currently Planning:
- Basic document content extraction

#### MISSING - Need to Extract:
- **Comment threads**: Who commented on what sections
- **Suggestion mode**: Who made suggestions, who accepted/rejected
- **Revision history**: Who made what edits when
- **Sharing history**: Who shared with whom
- **Real-time collaboration**: Who was editing simultaneously
- **Named ranges/bookmarks**: Collaborative organizational structure

#### Enhanced Google Extraction Needed:
```rust
// In your google_client.rs
pub struct GoogleDocumentCollaboration {
    pub document_id: String,
    pub comments: Vec<GoogleComment>,
    pub suggestions: Vec<GoogleSuggestion>,
    pub revisions: Vec<GoogleRevision>,
    pub sharing_events: Vec<SharingEvent>,
    pub simultaneous_editors: Vec<CollaborationSession>,
}

pub struct GoogleComment {
    pub id: String,
    pub author: String,           // MISSING
    pub content: String,
    pub anchor_text: String,      // MISSING: what text they commented on
    pub replies: Vec<GoogleCommentReply>, // MISSING
    pub resolved: bool,           // MISSING
    pub created_time: DateTime<Utc>,
}

pub struct GoogleSuggestion {
    pub id: String,
    pub author: String,           // MISSING: who suggested
    pub suggested_text: String,   // MISSING: what change they suggested
    pub original_text: String,    // MISSING: what it replaced
    pub status: SuggestionStatus, // MISSING: accepted/rejected/pending
    pub reviewer: Option<String>, // MISSING: who accepted/rejected
}

pub struct CollaborationSession {
    pub start_time: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub end_time: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub participants: Vec<String>, // MISSING: who was editing together
    pub edit_count: u32,          // MISSING: how active the session was
}
```

### 3. **Slack Integration - Missing Thread Dynamics**

#### Currently Planning:
- Basic message extraction

#### MISSING - Need to Extract:
- **Thread participation**: Who joined thread discussions  
- **Reaction details**: Who reacted with what emoji
- **Pin/bookmark events**: What messages got saved by whom
- **File sharing**: Who shared files in threads
- **App integrations**: Bot interactions, integrations used
- **Link unfurling**: What links were shared and discussed

#### Enhanced Slack Extraction Needed:
```rust
// In your slack_client.rs  
pub struct SlackThreadDynamics {
    pub thread_ts: String,
    pub channel_id: String,
    pub participants: Vec<ThreadParticipant>,
    pub message_flow: Vec<SlackMessage>,
    pub reactions_summary: ReactionsAnalysis,
    pub shared_content: Vec<SharedContent>,
    pub topic_evolution: Vec<TopicShift>,
}

pub struct ThreadParticipant {
    pub user_id: String,
    pub join_time: DateTime<Utc>,      // MISSING: when they first participated
    pub message_count: u32,            // MISSING: how much they contributed
    pub reaction_count: u32,           // MISSING: how much they reacted
    pub influence_score: f64,          // MISSING: calculated engagement impact
}

pub struct ReactionsAnalysis {
    pub total_reactions: u32,
    pub reaction_breakdown: HashMap<String, Vec<String>>, // MISSING: emoji -> [user_ids]
    pub reaction_timeline: Vec<ReactionEvent>,            // MISSING: when reactions happened
}

pub struct ReactionEvent {
    pub user_id: String,
    pub emoji: String,
    pub message_ts: String,            // MISSING: what message they reacted to  
    pub timestamp: DateTime<Utc>,      // MISSING: when they reacted
}

pub struct SharedContent {
    pub shared_by: String,
    pub content_type: String,          // MISSING: file, link, snippet
    pub content_url: Option<String>,   // MISSING: if it's a link/file
    pub discussion_thread: Vec<String>, // MISSING: who discussed this content
}
```

### 4. **Cross-Platform Connection Tracking - COMPLETELY MISSING**

#### Need to Build:
```rust
// New module: cross_platform_tracker.rs
pub struct CrossPlatformConnection {
    pub connection_id: String,
    pub discovered_by: DiscoveryMethod,
    pub confidence_score: f64,
    pub platforms_involved: Vec<String>,
    pub people_bridge: Vec<String>,    // who connects these platforms
    pub content_bridge: Vec<String>,   // what content connects them
    pub temporal_bridge: DateTime<Utc>, // when connection was made
}

// Track when Sarah shares a Google Doc link in a Jira comment
// Track when Mike references a Slack discussion in GitHub PR
// Track when a solution moves from Slack -> Google Doc -> Jira implementation
```

## ðŸš¨ **Critical Missing Infrastructure**

### 1. **People Identity Resolution**
You need to merge:
- `sarah.smith@company.com` (Google)  
- `ssmith` (Jira)
- `U123456` (Slack user ID)
- `sarah-smith` (GitHub)

Into one `Person` entity.

### 2. **Real-Time Relationship Building**
As you extract content, you need to:
- Detect when links are shared
- Track who participates in discussions  
- Build collaboration networks
- Update expertise scores
- Calculate influence metrics

### 3. **Graph Query Capabilities**
Your current search is text-based. You need graph queries like:
- "Show me Sarah's collaboration network"
- "What solutions did the Redis experts build together?"
- "Find authentication discussions that led to implementations"

## ðŸŽ¯ **Immediate Action Items**

### Phase 1: Enhanced Data Extraction (Week 1-2)
1. **Jira**: Extract comment authors, mentions, watchers
2. **Google**: Extract comment threads and collaboration data  
3. **Slack**: Extract thread participants and reaction details
4. **Identity**: Build person identity resolution system

### Phase 2: Relationship Building (Week 3-4)
1. **Cross-references**: Track when content links to other content
2. **People networks**: Build collaboration graphs
3. **Expertise tracking**: Calculate who knows what
4. **Temporal analysis**: Understand how knowledge evolves

### Phase 3: Graph Intelligence (Week 5-6)
1. **Graph queries**: Enable relationship-based search
2. **Expertise discovery**: "Who should I ask about X?"
3. **Solution tracking**: "How did we solve this before?"
4. **Knowledge gaps**: "What areas need documentation?"

## ðŸ”¥ **The Game-Changer**

With this enhanced schema, you could answer:

- **"Show me the authentication timeout solution network"**
  - Original Slack discussion (Mike, Sarah, Alex)
  - Google Doc architecture (Sarah â†’ shared with team)
  - Jira implementation ticket (assigned to Mike)
  - GitHub PR review (reviewed by Alex, approved by Sarah)
  - Follow-up tickets using same pattern (5 tickets, 3 different teams)

- **"Who are the Redis experts and how do they collaborate?"**
  - Sarah: 23 Redis contributions, 85% solution success rate
  - Mike: 15 Redis implementations, frequently builds on Sarah's designs
  - Network: Sarah proposes â†’ Mike implements â†’ Alex reviews
  - Knowledge flow: Slack discussions â†’ Google Docs â†’ Jira tickets

This is the **institutional memory** that makes organizations truly intelligent.
